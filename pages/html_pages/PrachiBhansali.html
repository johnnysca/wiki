<h1><strong>Prachi's favorites</strong>:</h1>
<p>Prachi states her favorite thing about Google is &quot;I love that there are always interesting problems to solve, in whichever field I am interested in.

Her favorite programming language is Java because it's easy to learn and very readable. Her favorite college course is Database Systems because she loved learning about the intricacies of databases and how they store millions on records, still keeping it accessible within reasonable time.

<h1><strong>Favorite quote</strong>:</h1>
<p>“Quit, don’t quit. Noodles, don’t noodles… You are too concerned with what was and what will be. There’s a saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.” </p>
<h1><strong>One skill learned during the pandemic</strong>:</h1>
<p>Prachi states, &quot;Learning from documentation and updating missing documentation for new members on the team. This is a very undervalued skill - good documentation can take up time when you start writing it but it makes life of everyone on the team significantly better in the long term&quot;.</p>
<h1><strong>Prachi's advice for future Tech professionals</strong>:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Reason with data, always. Any argument becomes twice as rich if presented with data.</li>
<li>Learn deeply by asking &quot;why&quot;, understand the status quo and challenge it with data if it does not seem right</li>
</ul>
