# About

Initially, this program provided a lot of us with the ability to network with individuals of similar backgrounds and interests. Though virtual, the program has definitely given the opportunity of meeting the diverse workforce of Google and the added benefit of learning from others with more experience. Behind a screen, it's easy to forget that these are all real people, so to catalogue each of these individuals this wikiâ€™s purpose is to create a hub of information accessible to the google tech students and mentors.
